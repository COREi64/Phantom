This is a variant of the original Phantom Reproduction found in this github that was supplied by John Barrel.

Based entirely on that work, this is an optimized reduced version of the original Trilogic Phantom.  The board is physically quite a bit smaller, and much easier to install as a result of this.
The design has been tested by the project creator and found to function correctly.  So for those looking to build a Phantom to experience what it was like, in a smaller easier to build package, this is certainly a version that could be considered.

Although there is no PCB at the moment for the parallel cable, I'm hoping that one will become available to make the deployment of this version easier, as it can be confusing as to how to wire the PCB without access to a convenient parallel cable PCB.
